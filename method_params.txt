keep_nogene_rxn	Remove No-gene Reactions	In the translated model certain reactions may be left without a gene assigned to them; entering "yes" in this field removes those reactions from the model.	
template_id	Template model	Models are generated based on a default template model in KBase. Template models capture the necessary biochemical information based on user-defined scope. KBase primarily uses four template models: (i) Gram positive microbe, (ii) Gram negative microbe, (iii) Core pathways microbe, and (iv) Plant. These template models differ from each other by biomass composition and biochemical reaction functional associations. KBase users currently do not have the option to choose or alter the default template model.	Template model name
