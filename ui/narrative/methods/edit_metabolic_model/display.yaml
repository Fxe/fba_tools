        ui-name : |
            Name of new compound
        short-hint : |
            Provide a human readable name (e.g. pyruvate) for the compound to be added. When adding a ModelSEED compound (modelseed.org), if no name is provided, the primary name for the compound in ModelSEED will be used.

    <p>Modify a metabolic model by adding or removing compounds and/or reactions, or changing the directionality of reactions. The major options and their parameters are:
    <ul>
    <li>Compounds to add to model: compounds to add, compartment of new compound, name of new compound, charge of new compound, and formula of new compound.</li>
    <li>Alter existing compounds in model: compound to change, new name for the compound, new charge for the compound, and new formula for the compound.</li>
    <li>Biomass objectives to add to model: new biomass name, growth-associated energy and fraction of biomass that is (i) DNA, (ii) RNA,(iii) protein, (ix) cell wall, (x) lipid, and (xi) cofactor. </li>
    <li>Biomass objective compounds to change: biomass reaction to alter, biomass compound to alter, and new biomass compound coefficient.</li>
    <li>Reactions to remove: select from the list of reactions in the model.</li>
    <li>Alter existing reactions in model: reaction to change, new reaction name, new reaction direction, and new reaction GPR.</li>
    <li>Add new reaction to model: new reaction ID, new reaction compartment, new reaction name, new reaction direction, and new reaction GPR.</li>
    <li>Alter the stoichiometry of reactions: reaction to alter, compound to alter, and new stoichiometric coefficient.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>In the parameter list, some of the parameters have the same name but different descriptions. This is because they belong to different major options.</p>
