parameters :
    fbamodel_output_id :
        ui-name : |
            Output model
        short-hint : |
            Enter a name for the metabolic model to be created.
        placeholder : |
            Output metabolic model name

    use_annotated_functions :
        ui-name : |
            Use annotation functions
        short-hint : |
            Use the annotated functional roles in the genome as the primary annoation source (must be RAST annotations at this time).

    source_ontology_list :
        ui-name : |
            Prioritized annotation sources
        short-hint : |
            Select the available annotation sources in this genome to use in model reconstruction in prioritized order.

    merge_all_annotations :
        ui-name : |
            Merge all selected annotations
        short-hint : |
            Merge all selected annotations mapping all associated reactions to genes even if annotation sources disaggree on function.

    template_id :
        ui-name : |
            Template for reconstruction
        short-hint : |
            Models are generated based on a default template model in KBase. Template models capture the necessary biochemical information based on user-defined scope.  KBase primarily uses four template models: (i) Gram positive microbe, (ii) Gram negative microbe, (iii) Core pathways microbe, and (iv) Plant. These template models differ from each other by biomass composition and biochemical reaction functional associations.

    genome_id :
        ui-name : |
            Genome
        short-hint : |
            A genome with functional annotations generated by RAST [2].
        placeholder : |
            Genome ID for modeling
    
    metagenome_model_id :
        ui-name : |
            Metagenome model with coverages
        short-hint : |
            If this is a metagenome assembled genome, a model of the metagenome with coverages computed can be supplied to propagate coverage data to this genome
        placeholder : |
            Metagenome model with coverages
            
    coverage_propagation :
        ui-name : |
            Coverage propagation method
        short-hint : |
            This drop down enables specification of how coverages will be propageted from the metagenome model to the MAG

    <p>This app uses the ModelSEED2 approach to build a genome-scale metabolic model for the input genome. Then the genome is characterized using the models to predict ATP production, auxotrophy, gap counts, and the distribution of genes across metabolic pathways.<p>
